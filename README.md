## Managing Website Content

All content displayed on the website, including product information, will be managed through the Django database. This ensures dynamic and efficient handling of website entries.

### Adding New Entries

1. **Products**: You can easily add new products to the website by accessing the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`. Log in with your superuser credentials, navigate to the "Products" section, and click "Add Product." Here, you can provide the following information for each product:

   - **Name**: The name of the product.
   - **Detail**: A description or details about the product.
   - **Image**: Upload an image of the product.

   After saving, the product will be displayed on the homepage and in the product catalog.

### Updating or Editing Entries

If you need to update or edit existing entries, you can do so through the admin panel as well. Simply find the product you want to modify, click on it, and make the necessary changes.

### Database Management

Django's powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) handles the underlying database operations. You can further customize the database schema and add more fields as needed in the Django models.

### Displaying Entries on the Homepage

The entries added or edited in the admin panel will automatically appear on the homepage and in the product catalog. Django templates and views ensure that the latest content is displayed to website visitors.

By utilizing the Django admin interface and database management capabilities, you can efficiently maintain and update the content of your e-commerce website.
